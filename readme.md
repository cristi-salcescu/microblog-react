### Microblog React Project
#### Source Code

This book takes a project-based learning approach by engaging you in building a practical application.

The Microblog application will be built using React with React Hooks and libraries like Redux, Redux Thunk, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, or Axios.

When creating the application you are going to encounter challenges like:

* authenticating the user, storing the authorization token, and then reuse it for other network calls

* displaying lists of items

* reading and validating form inputs

* searching

* adding and deleting items
